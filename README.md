## FAQ

#### How do I export textures?

You will have to join a world (single- or multiplayer) and execute `/openExportScreen`, click the build button and then start exporting using the start button. Depending on your system specifications, this could make your game lag a little.

#### Where are the textures getting exported to?

By default, textures are getting exported to `~/Pictures/textureexportmod/` so if your username is johndoe textures would be located in `/home/johndoe/Pictures/textureexportmod` or `C:\Users\johndoe\Pictures\textureexportmod` depending on your Operating System
